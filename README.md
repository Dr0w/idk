I am truly humbled that you've gone out of your day to stalk me. Because otherwise, I have no idea how the hell you would've found my git repo. Unless you're David. Hi David, if you're reading this. Disregard if you're not David.
If your name is also David, I'm not talking to you. No one likes you, go away. This David knows which David I'm talking about.
